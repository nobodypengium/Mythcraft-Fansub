209
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,044
The basic gist
of what I'm gonna be doing

210
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,379
is casting a neck
out of ballistics gelatin.

211

How tall is this neck?
Who were these men?

with "blood" that will be blue

214
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,543
It needs to be really close
to the edge of the skin.

215
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:47,646
So I'm gonna effectively
mold those veins

216

00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:53,852

inside out and backwards.

of the blood vessels in place,

it's time to prepare
the fake flesh.

220
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,833
As Jamie and I have discovered,
this stuff reacts to a bullet

221

similar to human flesh,

222
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:12,170
but to get the tenacity
of skin and muscle,

223
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:15,857
we need to add this fiberglass
filler to the ballistics gel

224

into my mold.

Once it starts to move
into the neck,

it doesn't wanna just
bounce off

because it's so heavy.

get bigger,

the dangers they present
are absolutely real.

Oh, that's delicious.

769

difficult to fly and land?

such mammoth flight times...

Gonna start by dropping
the gears.

781

a little bit of a clunk.

Narrator: The Dragon Lady
lands tail-wheel first

787
00:37:04,157 --> 00:37:06,990
at a speed that practically
stalls the wing.

788

And with only two sets
of landing gear

789
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:13,013
in the center of the fuselage,
it's like landing a bicycle.

790
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:16,800
The pilot has floored
the landing gear

791
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,703
and implemented
several procedures to add drag

792
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:22,989
so that it's moving slow enough
when we get to the runway,

793
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:24,910
then we can actually land.

794
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:27,394
Narrator: That's not all.
There's the ground effect.

795

The u-2's high-aspect ratio
wings and commensurate uplift

796
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:35,452
means that on final approach,
it tends to float,

to control.

has such limited visibility

that he can't even see
the runway

865
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:46,176
it is a completely unique
airframe purpose-built

866
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:49,012
for a completely
unique mission.

867
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:51,231
It requires a more numerous
flight crew

868
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,383
and a more exhausted set
of protocols

869
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:55,120
than any other plane
in the military.

870
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,621
And it is the only
airborne endeavor

871
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,089
besides going to space
that requires

872
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,659
the wearing
of the space suit.

873
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,859
This is not a bad way
to spend your day.

874
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:06,646
I think that places it
in the plausible category.

875
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:08,900
Okay.
All right.

876
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:11,351
I think it also places it
in the "ultra cool" category.

877
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:14,688
Absolutely.
Let's get out of here.

878
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:22,314
So, Adam, do you know why
she's called "the Dragon Lady"?

879
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:22,848
No, I don't.

880
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:25,165
'Cause you don't know whether
she's gonna land like a dragon

881
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:28,268
or a lady.
